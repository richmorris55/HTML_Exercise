      <h1> Richard Morris</h1>
      <p>I was Born in Texas on September 30th, 1989. 
        I grew up there till I was 9, then moved to Colorado. 
        I left Colorado at 19 to attend college at Texas State University in San Marcos Texas. 
        After College, I moved back to Colorado where I met my wife and had a beautiful daughter. 
        Unfortunately, my marriage did not work out and over the past 4 years I was lead to Oregon for work. 
        After the last job did not work out I decided to pursue Software Engineering! 
        I am aspiring to eventually obtain an entry level position that will allow me to have a better work life balance for the benefit of my daughter!

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
